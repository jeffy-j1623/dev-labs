# 🎯 CSS Syntax & Selectors — Learn First

## 📌 Overview

This folder marks the **foundation stage of my CSS learning path**.

Before learning layout systems (Flexbox, Grid), responsiveness, or design techniques, this section focuses on **how CSS actually works** at its core:

- How CSS rules are written (syntax)
- How CSS targets HTML elements (selectors)
- How the browser decides *what gets styled*

The goal here is **clarity, not visual design**.

> If selectors and syntax are strong, everything else in CSS becomes easier.S

## 🧾 Summary

- This section establishes the **foundation of CSS** through syntax and selectors.
- CSS **syntax** ensures the browser can correctly read and apply rules.
- CSS **selectors** determine *which* HTML elements receive those rules.
- Learning these topics in isolation prevents confusion in later CSS concepts.
- Every subfolder is designed for **focused practice**, not visual design.
- Mastery here makes layout, responsiveness, and frameworks easier to learn.

> **Strong syntax + clear selector logic = predictable CSS behavior.**
