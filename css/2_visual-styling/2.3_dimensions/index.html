    <h3> Who will cry when you die? </h3>
    <h4> Take more risks</h4>
        <p class="para1">I'll make you this promise: on your deathbed, in the twilight of your life, it will not be all the risks you took 
        that you will regret the most. Rather, what will fill your heart with the greatest amount of regret and sadness will 
        be all those risks that you did not take, all those opportunities you did not seize and all those fears you did not
        face. Remember that on the other side of fear lies freedom. And stay focused on the timeless success principle that
        says: "life is nothing more that a game of numbers - the more risks you take, the more rewards you will receive." Or
       in the words of Sophocles, "Fortune is not on the side of the faint-hearted."  </p>
       <p class="p2">To live your life to the fullest, start taking more risks and doing the things you fear. Get good at being 
        uncom-fortable and stop walking the path of least resistance. Sure, there is a greater chance you will stub your toes when you walk the road less traveled, but that 
       is the only way you can get anywhere. As my wise mother always says, you cannot get to third base with one foot on 
       second." Or as André Gide observed. "One does not discover new lands without consenting to lose sight of the shore 
       for a very long time.</p>
       <p class="p3">The real secret to a life of abundance is to stop spending your days searching for security and
       to start spending your time pursuing opportunity. Sure, you will meet with your share of failures if you start living
       more deliberately and passionately. But failure is nothing more than learning how to win. Or as my dad observed one day,
       "Robin, it's risky out on a limb. But that's where all the fruit is.</p>
