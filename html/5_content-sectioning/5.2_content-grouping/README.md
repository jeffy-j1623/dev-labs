# 🧱 Content Grouping in HTML

## 🎯 Purpose:

This section explains the HTML elements used to **group and organize content** meaningfully within a webpage. These elements help improve structure, accessibility, and semantics, or offer layout flexibility.

## 📑 Core Elements

| **Tag**       | **Description**                                                    |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<article>`   | Self-contained, reusable content         |
| `<section>`   | Thematic grouping of related content    |
| `<aside>`     | Tangential content       |
| `<div>`       | Generic block-level container      |

---

## 🔑 Summary:

- `<article>`: Use for **independent** content that can stand on its own (e.g., news articles, ).
- `<section>`: Best for **thematically grouped content**, often with a heading. (e.g., chapters, sections) 
- `<aside>`: Ideal for **complementary** or **side content** not essential to the main flow.(e.g., sidebars, callouts, related links) 
- `<div>`: A **non-semantic** block used for layout and structure when no suitable semantic tag exists.
