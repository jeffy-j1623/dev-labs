    <h1>Self Intro</h1>
    <p>
    Hey there! I am Jeffy. I’m starting my journey into web development, currently learning HTML and excited to explore CSS, JavaScript, and other
    frontend technologies. My goal is to gain hands-on experience by working on real-world projects and continuously improving my skills.
    Beyond coding, I enjoy expressing my creativity through Resin Art and designing visuals using Canva. I love exploring new
    skills and enjoy combining creativity with modern tools in design and web development.
    I’m eager to learn, collaborate with developers, and build creative web experiences. Open to opportunities that help me 
    grow and apply my knowledge in practical ways. Looking forward to connecting with others in the tech community!
