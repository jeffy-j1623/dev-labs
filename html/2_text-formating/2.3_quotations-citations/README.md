# üìù Quotations & Citations

## üìå Purpose

This section explores the HTML semantic tags used to mark up quotations, citations, and related concepts like abbreviations and definitions. Understanding these tags is essential for creating accessible, well-structured content, particularly in academic, literary, and informative writing.

## üìå Core Elements

| **Tag**        | **Type**    | **Description**                                     |
| -------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `<blockquote>` | Block-level | Defines long block quotations from another source   |
| `<q>`          | Inline      | Inline short quotations (auto adds quotation marks) |
| `<cite>`       | Inline      | Title of a creative work or cited source            |

## üöÄ My Learning Experience

- **Initial Challenge:**

  - At first, I struggled with understanding the difference between `<q>` and `<blockquote>`. Both are used for quotations, but I wasn‚Äôt sure when to use one over the other. I also misunderstood the purpose of the `<cite>` tag, thinking it was only used for linking to URLs rather than referencing the title of a creative work.
  - I figured it out by testing things out on my [Blog](https://github.com/jeffy-j1623/dev-portfolio/blob/main/mini-projects/psycology-blog.html) , using `<q>` for short quotes within sentences, `<blockquote>` for longer ones, and `<cite>` to give proper credit to the source. It clicked when I saw it in action.
  - I practiced using these tags in various scenarios, like writing blog posts and adding quotes from books or articles. I found that combining `<cite>` with `<blockquote>` helped me give proper credit to the original source of longer quotes.

- **Breakthrough Moment:**

  - The breakthrough came when I realized the significance of using these tags for accessibility. The browser adding quotation marks around `<q>` made my code cleaner and easier to maintain. I also recognized that using `<cite>` for titles rather than just URLs made my content more structured and meaningful, improving the overall readability and usability.

- **Noteworthy Discovery:**

  - I discovered that using `<blockquote>` for longer quotations ensures that the attribution is clear, and the optional `cite` attribute allows me to link back to the original source.
  - I also learned that using `<cite>` for referencing titles of works helps with both search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility. It‚Äôs not just a visual cue, but a semantic one that makes the content more meaningful.
  - I applied this knowledge in a personal blog project, where I used `<blockquote>` for large excerpts from books, and `<q>` for smaller, inline quotes. This practice not only helped structure my content but also enhanced its clarity and reliability.

## üìå Summary

- **`<blockquote>`** is used for longer, block-level quotations, often with an optional `cite` attribute to link back to the source.
- **`<q>`** is for inline quotes, and browsers automatically add quotation marks.
- **`<cite>`** is used to reference the title of creative works (books, articles, movies, etc.).
