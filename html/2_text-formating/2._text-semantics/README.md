# Text Semantics in HTML

## 🎯 Purpose:

Semantic text tags help convey the *meaning* and *intention* behind specific portions of your content. Rather than merely styling text, these tags express **emphasis**, **importance**, and **text changes**, which improves accessibility, SEO, and overall document clarity.

## 📌 Core Elements:

| **Tag**        | **Description**                                        |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `<strong>`     | Indicates strong importance or seriousness             |
| `<em>`         | Emphasizes text with stress or subtle importance       |
| `<del>`        | Represents deleted or outdated content                 |
| `<ins>`        | Represents inserted or newly added content             |

## 🚀 My Learning Experience

- **Initial Challenge:**

  - I used `<strong>` and `<em>` mainly to style text as bold or italic without realizing that they actually carry meaning and improve accessibility.
  - I didn’t pay much attention to the difference between `<b>` vs `<strong>` or `<i>` vs `<em>`—I just wanted the text to “look” right.

- **Breakthrough Moment:**

  - While testing my page with a screen reader, I noticed that `<strong>` and `<em>` were actually read with vocal emphasis. That’s when it clicked—these tags are not just for looks, they guide assistive technologies.
  - I also found that `<del>` and `<ins>` are perfect for blog edits or showing what's changed in a document—no need to fake it with strikethroughs or colors in CSS.

- **Noteworthy Discovery:**

  - Using semantic tags made my code more organized and meaningful, especially when I started thinking about SEO and accessibility.
  - Now, I rely on `<strong>` and `<em>` whenever I want to highlight content *intentionally*, not just visually, and I use `<del>` and `<ins>` when showing content revisions during write-ups or content updates. 
  - I got a idea to make a mini project on [product-offer-page ](https://github.com/jeffy-j1623/dev-portfolio/tree/main/mini-projects/product-offer-page) `<del>` and `<ins>`.

## 🔑 Summary:

- Use `<strong>` to mark important, serious, or urgent text.
- Use `<em>` to stress emphasis or subtle importance.
- `<del>` and `<ins>` help represent edits or changes in content.
- These tags are semantic, accessible, and should be preferred over purely visual alternatives.
