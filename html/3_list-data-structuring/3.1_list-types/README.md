# 📋 HTML Lists

## 🎯 Purpose:

This section explains the various types of lists in HTML, including unordered lists (`<ul>`), ordered lists (`<ol>`), and definition lists (`<dl>`), which help organize content in a structured way.

## 📑 Core Elements

| **Tag**  | **Description**                          |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `<ul>`   | Unordered list (items displayed with bullets) |
| `<ol>`   | Ordered list (items displayed with numbers) |
| `<li>`   | List item (used in all list types)      |
| `<dl>`   | Definition list (pairs of terms and definitions) |
| `<dt>`   | Definition term (used inside `<dl>`)    |
| `<dd>`   | Definition description (used inside `<dl>`) |~

## 🔑 Summary:

- **`<ul>`**: Use for lists where the order doesn't matter (e.g., shopping lists).
- **`<ol>`**: Use when the order is important (e.g., step-by-step instructions).
- **`<li>`**: Used to define each list item in both unordered and ordered lists.
- **`<dl>`**: Ideal for glossaries, definitions, and explanations.
- **`<dt>`** and **`<dd>`**: Used in definition lists to provide term-description pairs.
