## üöÄ My Learning Experience

- Initial Challenge:

  - I didn‚Äôt know the difference between `<q>` and `<blockquote>`, and I didn‚Äôt realize `<cite>` was for titles, not just URLs.

- Breakthrough:

  - Learned to use `<abbr title="...">` for accessibility ‚Äî now readers and screen readers both get value!

  - Found that `<dfn>` helps in glossaries and documentation.

- Cool Use Case:

  - I used `<cite>` to style book titles and `<blockquote>` in blog posts with attribution links.

  ## üîë Summary:

  - Use `<blockquote>` for long quotes with optional citation links.

  - Use `<q>` for inline quotes ‚Äî browser automatically adds quotation marks.

  - Use `<cite>` for works (books, reports, articles, songs).

  - Use `<abbr>` for acronyms with title to show expanded form.

  - Use `<dfn>` when defining a new term in documentation or learning resources.
