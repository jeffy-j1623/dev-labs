# Text Basics in HTML

## 🎯 Purpose:

Text is a fundamental part of any webpage. This section covers the essential elements for structuring text properly.

## 📌 Core Elements:

| **Tag**         | **Usage**                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `<h1>` - `<h6>` | Headings (largest to smallest) |
| `<p>`           | Paragraphs for text blocks     |
| `<br>`          | Line breaks                    |
| `<hr>`          | Horizontal separators          |

## 🚀 My Learning Experience

- **Initial Challenge:**

  - Understanding the significance of the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags in organizing content hierarchically, even though they don’t directly affect the visual design of the page.
  - Then, I finally recognized that using the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags in hierarchical order and using the `<h1>` tag only once as the main heading of the webpage enhances accessibility, SEO, and responsiveness. Until then, I had used the `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags in a non-hierarchical manner for my own customized headings and used multiple `<h1>` tags, thinking that it would make each section of my webpage look better.

- **Breakthrough Moment:**

  - Realizing that overusing the `<br>` tag for spacing can clutter the code, and that CSS offers a cleaner, more efficient way to manage layout and spacing.
  - Since I'm currently learning HTML as a beginner, my focus is on fully exploring and utilizing HTML5 features and elements.

- **Noteworthy Discovery:**

  - The `<hr>` tag visually separates sections, but in HTML5, it no longer carries semantic meaning—it's purely decorative.
  - I have explored the `<hr>` tag and used it to divide sections.

## 🔑 Summary:

- Headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) define structure and importance.
- Paragraphs (`<p>`) are the main building blocks for text.
- `<br>` creates line breaks but should be used minimally.
- `<hr>` visually separates sections and improves readability.
