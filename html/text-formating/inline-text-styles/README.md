## üöÄ My Learning Experience

- **Initial Challenge:**

  - Initially, I confused **`<b>` and `<strong>`**, as well as **`<i>` and `<em>`**, assuming they were interchangeable.
  - TThen I realized my mistake and started using `<b>` and `<i>` strictly for visual styling. I also learned that `<strong>` and `<em>` provide real semantic value, improving both SEO and accessibility by helping search engines and screen readers better understand the importance of the content.

- **Breakthrough Moment:**

  - I used to think the `<ins>` and `<del>` tags were just for styling like striking a word and highlight a word related to the word, but I realized they are meant to show inserted and deleted content. This helps track changes, especially when working with others.
  - So these tags improved my understanding about accessibility and add meaningful structure to content, rather than just focusing on visual appearance. This changed how I approached editing and version control.

- **Noteworthy Discovery:**
  - `<small>` is used to display smaller text, useful for disclaimers or fine print.
  - Recognizing the importance of `<sub>` and `<sup>` for scientific and mathematical notation rather than just for styling.

## üîë Summary:

- Use semantic elements (`<strong>`, `<em>`, `<ins>`, `<del>`) when meaning matters.
- Use non-semantic elements (`<b>`, `<i>`, `<u>`) for purely visual effects.
- `<mark>` helps emphasize key points, while `<small>` is great for legal text and disclaimers.
