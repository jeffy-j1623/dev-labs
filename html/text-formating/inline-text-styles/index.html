    <h1>A Chapter from my fav book</h1>
    <h2>Who will cry when you die?</h2>
    <h3>Discover Your Calling</h3>

    <p>When I was growing up, my father said to me I will never forget, <b>"Son, when you are born, you cried while the whole
        rejoiced. Live your life in such a way that when you die the world cries while you rejoice."</b> We live in an age 
        when we have forgotten what life is all about. We can easily put a person on the moon, but we have trouble walking 
        across the street to meet a new neighbor. We can fire a  missile across the world with pinpoint accuracy, but we have 
        trouble keeping a date with our children to go to the library. We have email, fax machines and digital phones so that 
        we can stay connected and yet we live in a time where human beings have never less connected. We have lost touch with 
        our humanity. We have lost touch with our purpose. We have lost sight of the things that matter the most.

    And so, as you start this book, I respectfully ask you, <strong>Who will cry when you die?</strong> How many lives will you 
    touch while you have the privilege to walk this planet? What impact will your life have on the generations that follow you? 
    And what legacy will you leave behind after you have taken your last breath? One of the lessons I have learned in my own life
    is that <i> if you don't act on life, life has a habit of acting on you.</i> The days slip into weeks, the weeks slip into months and 
    the months slip into years. Pretty soon it's all over and you are left with nothing more than a heart filled with regret over 
    a life half lived. George Bernard Shaw was asked on his deathbed, "What would you do if you could live your life over again?"
    He reflected, then replied with a deep sigh: "I'd like to be the person I could have been but never was." I've written this 
    book so that this will never happen to you.

     As a professional speaker, I spend much of my work life delivering keynote addresses at conferences across North America,
    flying from city to city, sharing my insights on leadership in business and in life with many different people. Though they
    all come from diverse walks of life, their questions invariably center on the same things these days: How can I find greater
    meaning in my life? How can I make a lasting contribution through my work? and How can I simplify so that I can enjoy the 
    journey of life before it is too late?
    </p>

    <p>
     My answer always begins the same way: <em>Find your calling.</em> I believe we all have special talents that are just waiting to be
    engaged in a worthy pursuit. We are all here for some unique purpose, some noble objective that will allow us to manifest 
    our highest human potential while we, at the same time, add value to the lives around us. Finding your calling doesn't mean
    you must leave the job you now have. It simply means you need to bring more of yourself into your work and focus on the
    things you do best. It means you have to stop waiting for other people to make the changes you desire and, as Mahatma Gandhi 
    noted: <u>"Be the change that you wish to see most in your world." And once you do, your life will change. </u>
